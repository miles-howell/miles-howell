I'm a machine learning developer and founder with a background in mathematics, physics, and systems engineering. I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

Currently, I'm leading **[Planned Pixel](https://www.plannedpixel.com)** in its pivot from a web design studio to an AI-driven product company. My primary focus is on developing a **multi-modal AI system** at the intersection of **computer vision and sentiment analysis**. Our goal is to provide powerful marketing insights for small and medium-sized businesses, leveraging cutting-edge models to understand audience engagement in ways that were previously only accessible to large enterprises.

I document my technical journey, explore ML concepts, and share my thoughts on technology and society on my blog: **[blog.plannedpixel.com](https://blog.plannedpixel.com)**.
